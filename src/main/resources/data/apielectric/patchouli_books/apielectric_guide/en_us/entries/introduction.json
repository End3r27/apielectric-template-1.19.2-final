      "text": "Welcome to the *Energy Apiary* – where bees are too busy generating electricity to fly! That's right, unlike regular bees who are out buzzing around, these bees are a bit more *stationary*. Why? Because they're too focused on converting the energy from their little bee bodies into usable HoneyCharge! In the ApiElectric mod, we’ve taken bees to the next level of productivity. Forget honey, these bees are all about the energy, so get ready to harness their *electrifying* power!"
